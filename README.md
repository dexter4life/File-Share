# FileShare2
A peer to peer file sharing system for windows

Due to the complex nature of windows networking, many people find it hard to network their system mostly when they are in areas that aren't home to them. This includes coffee shop, restaurants and even car and buses. Thus this project is aimed at providing a free open source application that makes this possible. Any one can contribute to this project provided they abide to the licence agreement stated.
